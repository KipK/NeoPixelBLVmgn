NeoPixel sketch for the great 3D-Printer project from Ben Levi (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3382718)

With this sketch you can use Neopixels to show the hotend- and heatbed-temperature and the different printer status including print progress.
Get nearly full control on the NeoPixels and their configuration and use even totally different types of NeoPixels, change colors, switch animations on/off, change brightness, set offsets and so on.

Requirements:
- Tested with Arduino Mega, Nano and Mini Pro (Wiring as shown on the Thingiverse-Page)
- Adafruit.NeopixelLibrary (minimum version 1.2.3) (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)
- PanelDue connected to the Duet mainboard

How to configure the sketch to your personal needs? 
Just change the parameters in the marked "User-Config" part in the sketch file before compiling and uploading it to your Arduino.
